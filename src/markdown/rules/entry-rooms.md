To gain entry into Kisetsucon, attendees are required to have their badges worn and easily visible. A Kisetsucon Staff or Volunteer member will be checking badges at the entrance to the event as well as periodically roaming the halls. If you do not have a badge for any reason, you will be directed to a location where you can obtain one.

Attendees will not be allowed into an event room until the scheduled time of the event.

No attendees will be allowed in a room once capacity has been reached. If an attendee needs to leave a room which is already full, they may not re-enter the room.

All rooms will be cleared after each event. Attendees may not wait in a room after an event has ended.

There is no reserved or saved seating for attendees in any room at the convention. Seating may be desginated for those with disabilities.
