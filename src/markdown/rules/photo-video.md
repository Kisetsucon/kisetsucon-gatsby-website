All Kisetsucon attendees grant permission to be photographed or recorded by authorized members of the Kisetsucon Staff for promotional and archival purposes.

Attendees may photograph or video record events at Kisetsucon unless otherwise directed at specific events or panels.

Is it common courtesy to ask for permission before taking photos and/or videos of other attendees.
Especially so with attendees in cosplay. Remember, Cosplay is not Consent.
