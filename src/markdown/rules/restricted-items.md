Smoking is permitted outside the venue, but nowhere inside the building.

Outside food and drink are not allowed within the venue.

Food may not be sold or given away at the convention. Anyone found doing this will have the items confiscated and given a warning. This is to protect convention attendees as well as a venue rule.
