title: 'Costume Rules'
---
All costumes must fall in a PG-13 rating. Kisetsucon Staff may determine if a costume is appropriate for the convention. If your costume does not meet the convention rules or is deemed inappropriate by Kisetsucon staff, you will be asked to cover up your costume or change into a different outfit.

If your view is obstructed, please have a guide to direct you. Full face masks/headwear must be easily removable.

If you and your costume require more than one seat in any event or panel or obstructs the view of any other attendee, Kisetsucon Staff may designate seating for you that causes the least disruption.

If you wish to take part in the Cosplay Contest, in addition to the guidelines, you must adhere to the Kisetsucon Cosplay Contest Rules.

Please contact us if you have any questions or concerns.
