title: 'Lines'
---
Attendees may not start lining up more 30 minutes before an event. Kisetsucon Staff and Volunteers will break up and reform the lines at their discretion.

There is no sitting in walkways or stairs.

If you leave a line, you must re-enter at the back of the line.

You may not save a spot for a friend or group. Violaters will be sent to the end of the line.

Lines are single-file only. No large groups may stand together in line. Lines will be in hallways, which must stay clear for regular traffic flow and in the event of an emergency.

Kisetsucon Staff reserves the right to make on-site decisions about lines and events in order to accomodate the specific location at that specific time.
