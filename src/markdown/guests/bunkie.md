We welcome our next cosplay guest Bunkie!
Bunkie has been a cosplayer for over 5 years. She creates craftsmanship focused costumes that utilize a mix of tailoring and armor work. She has won craftsmanship contests across cons in New York state, most notably 3rd place in the Eastern Crown Championships of cosplay in the video game division at New York Comic Con in 2015.

She has been highlighted by Blizzard, Dexerto, Adafruit, Wowhead, and Overwatch World for her Overwatch cosplays.

She has an affinity for video game cosplays and her favorite part of the process and seeing other completed costumes is a fantastic paint job that is accurate to the character.

When she isn’t cosplaying, she is moderating Kamui’s Cosplay Community, a group on facebook that helps cosplayers learn more about cosplay construction, or playing games or creating while streaming on twitch.
